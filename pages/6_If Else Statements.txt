If/Else Statements
One of the most important functions in any coding language is the `if()` statement```js
if(true){
   //this gets executed
} else {

}
```With booleans, you can simply put the variable inside the parentheses (), as it will automatically be true```js
const bool = true
if(bool) {
//this executes
}
```For other types of variables, you can use these operators:```js
// == (Is equal to)
if(x == 1)
// != (Is not equal to)
if(x != 1)
// < / > (Is greater/less than)
if(x > 1)
if(x < 1)
// <= / >= (Is greater/less than or equal to)
if(x <= 1)
if(x >= 1)
//NOTE: => and =< do not work (=> is used to define a function, you can see it in the client.on statements)
```If you want to use multiple conditions, you can use these operators as well```js
// && (and)
if(condition1 && condition2)
// || (Or)
// ! (Not)
if(!condition1)```
