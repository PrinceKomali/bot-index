Variable Types
There are 5 main variable types: Numbers, Booleans, Strings, Arrays, and Objects
Numbers are, well, numbers. Simple as that```js
var num = 9.136
```Booleans are also really easy; they only have 2 values: True and False```js
var bool1 = true
var bool2 = false
```Strings are plain text, and are probably the most used as far as I can tell```js
var str = "This is a string"
```Arrays are lists of data, such as numbers, strings, or other arrays```js
var arr = ["element 1", 2, false]
```Objects are  basically multi-part arrays, although you call the values differently```js
var obj = {
           "val1": "val1a",
           "val2": "val2a"
           }
```
