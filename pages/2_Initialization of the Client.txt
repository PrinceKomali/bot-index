Initializing the Client
To actually put your bot online, we will need to setup the code. Open the `index.js` file and type this:```js
const Discord = require('discord.js')
const client = new Discord.Client()
```This sets up the dependencies your code will use as it's running. Next we will need our token from Page 2: ```js
const Discord = require('discord.js')
const client = new Discord.Client()
client.login("TOKEN GOES HERE")``` (Make sure to add the quotation marks!)
To start the bot, run `node index.js` in the Commant Prompt/Shell/Terminal window. If you followed these steps correctly you should see your bot online	

To set the bot's status, we will need to create a `client.on('ready)` handler. Underneath all the previous code, write```js
client.on('ready', () => {

})
```Now we can write the script to set the bot's status:```js
client.on('ready', () => {   
   client.user.setActivity("This is my status!", {
      type: "PLAYING"
   })
})
```You can set the type to "PLAYING", "WATCHING", "LISTENING", and "STREAMING". However, streaming requires an extra step:```js
    client.user.setActivity("This is my status!", {
      type: "STREAMING",
      url: "https://example.com/"
   })
```You can put any URL in the `url` part, but I recommend putting your twitch channel there.
