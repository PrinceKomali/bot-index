Advanced String Functions
A lot of the time you are going to need to change a string in other ways than just adding or replacing parts of it. However, there are lots of functions to do so:```js
const str = "This Is A String"
console.log(str.toLowerCase())
   //Output: this is a string
console.log(str.toUpperCase())
   //Output: THIS IS A STRING
console.log(str.length) //Returns the length of the string
   //Output: 16
console.log(str.charAt(n)) //Returns the character at position n
   //if n = 3, Output: i
console.log(str.substring(a, b)) //Returns the section of the string between a and b
   //if a = 2, b = 6, Output: is I
console.log(str.startsWith(string))
   //if string = "This", Ouput: true
```There are a couple more but for the most part this is what you will be using.
