Random
Lets say we have this array of messages:```js
["Response 1", "Response 2", "Response 3"]
```and we want to send a random one using a message.channel.send(). For this, we can use the `Math.random()` function.
`Math.random()` returns a random number from 0 - 1, so it will need a bit of modification. Here is the typical randomization code:```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * n)
````Math.random() * n` multiplies that random number by whatever length you want, which makes it a random number that is now between 0 and the number you chose
Then `Math.floor` shaves off the decimals, and we are left with a single digit. From there we can simply do```js
var responses = ["Response 1", "Response 2", "Response 3"]
message.channel.send(responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)])
```If you want to get a random number between two numbers, simply subtract the two numbers and add the lower number to the output```js
//Between 2 and 5
Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 2```
